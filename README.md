# Recipe-App

**Problem Statement** **:**

How many times have you heard this? How many times did you think it? Me too! Thatâ€™s why I was determined to think of a way to simplify this process and reduce the time from thinking of a meal and begin to cook. The endless wondering of what to eat is a burden to us all. 
Many people don't find the correct steps to cook the food.


**Proposed Solution :**

For Cooking lovers our "Recipe-App" is a one solution for new recipes.

We provide the steps of cooking with the amount of ingredients required for the dish, and some Youtube tutorials.
You can explore and cook new dishes everyday.
Their are many categories available
- Pasta
- Starter
- Breakfast 
- Dessert

- User can view the Dish Tutorial by clicking on YOUTUBE button and it will redirect the link to the youtube video.
- Linear Lyout
- Recycler View


**Application Link & Future Scope :**

You can access the app from Github using [link](https://github.com/gsaksham108/Recipe-App)


In future we will add more dishes and help people by adding a Chat System so they can share problems faced by them and we can resolve it.
And we will be adding a feedback page to the application so that everyone can share their experiences and can suggest new dishes that we add to the menu.
